# K-Means-Clustering_Public-Private-Universities
Here we will use K Means Clustering to cluster universities into two grups, Private and Public. We already have the labels Private and 
Public given to us. But we will not use them. Normally in 'real world problems' K Means Clustering is an unsupervised algorithm. Meaning 
normally K Means Clustering is used on unlabeled data (unsupervised) to see if you can find meaningful and useful separation among 
unlabeled data. Here we will just ignore the labels and treat it as one unlabeled group. Then compare it back to the known labels as an 
indicator of how well the clustering algorithm performed.
